                    <p>The Nigerian Medical Association is the largest medical association in the West African sub-region with over 40,000 members from 36 state branches and the branch from the federal capital territory with about 19,000 in Diaspora. 70%
                        of doctors practice in urban areas where only 30% of the population resides. The population of Nigeria is about 160million. Policy decisions are made by the Association’s National Executive Council (NEC) which is the governing
                        body. The constitution of NMA is supreme and its provisions shall have binding force on all authorities, organs, branches and members of the Association and, where applicable, on any other persons. Any Act CAP 221 Laws of the federation
                        of Nigeria (1990) and as subsequently amended shall have a right of membership of the Association on payment of the annual practicing fee in the said Act as may be reviewed from time to time, unless otherwise prescribed herein
                        in the constitution. The National Executive Council is the governing body of the Association and has full powers to act on its behalf in the period between the Annual Delegates’ Meetings in accordance with the provisions of the
                        Constitution of the Association unless otherwise stated in the constitution.</p>
                    <p>Although the Association is involved in many of the government’s activities, it is consulted formally by the government only on an ad-hoc’ basis. It is not consulted ad ‘of right’ on health issues and has to press for its participation.
                        The Association nominates eleven members of the Medical & Dental Council of Nigeria which regulates the practice of medicine & dentistry in Nigeria and the curricula of its medical schools.</p>
                    <p>The NMA is at present involved in influencing health policy formulation in an ad hoc manner. This is done by making unsolicited recommendations to government on various health issues and also by making-inputs, whenever invited, to
                        some of the national committee meetings on policy formulations.</p>
                    <p>The Association holds training courses for doctors, and participates in radio programmes and TV talk shows. It has several on-going projects including those on AIDS, on family planning and on primary health care. Project development
                        is dependent upon outside funding. Funding agencies supporting the Association’s activities include UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO, USAID, The Ford Foundation, and the John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation.</p>
                    <p>The Association collaboration in specific projects on health issues with individual NGOs and with National Association of Non-Government Organizations on health (NANGOH)</p>
                    <p>The NMA plans to make in-roads into the Federal Ministry of health to ensure that it is involved on all aspects of policy formulation, especially in the planning stages.</p>
                    <p>It is also planned that the NMA continues to cooperate with government in project development so that the association many be represented on the delegations to regional an international health conferences.</p>
                    <p>The NMA is the host of the permanent Secretariat of the Confederation of African Medical Associations and Societies (CAMAS). The Association is developing a proposal to involve all African Medical Associations and Societies (Anglophone,
                        Francophone and Arabic-speaking) in efforts to improve reproductive health and safe motherhood in African.</p>
